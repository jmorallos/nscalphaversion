# Error Fixes - Round 2

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ React ForwardRef Warnings

**Errors:**
```
Warning: Function components cannot be given refs. Attempts to access this ref will fail.
Check the render method of `SlotClone`.
```

**Root Cause:**
Several UI components (Button, DialogOverlay, DialogContent) were not using `React.forwardRef`, which is required when components are used with Radix UI primitives that need to attach refs.

**Fix Applied:**

#### Button Component (`/components/ui/button.tsx`)
Changed from regular function to forwardRef:

**Before:**
```typescript
function Button({ className, variant, size, asChild = false, ...props }) {
  // ...
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
const Button = React.forwardRef<HTMLButtonElement, ...>(
  ({ className, variant, size, asChild = false, ...props }, ref) => {
    return <Comp ref={ref} ... />;
  }
);
Button.displayName = "Button";
```

#### DialogOverlay Component (`/components/ui/dialog.tsx`)
Applied the same forwardRef pattern.

#### DialogContent Component (`/components/ui/dialog.tsx`)
Applied the same forwardRef pattern.

**Result:** All ref warnings are now eliminated. Components properly forward refs to their underlying DOM elements or Radix primitives.

### 2. ✅ Login Error - No Admin Account

**Error:**
```
AuthApiError: Invalid login credentials
```

**Root Cause:**
Users were trying to login but no admin account existed in the system yet.

**Fix Applied:**

Added a prominent "Setup Admin Account" link on the login page:

**File:** `/components/AuthPage.tsx`

```tsx
{/* Setup Admin Link */}
<div className="mt-6 text-center">
  <p className="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2">Need to create an admin account?</p>
  <button
    onClick={onShowSetup}
    className="text-sm text-blue-600 hover:underline"
  >
    Setup Admin Account
  </button>
</div>
```

**User Flow:**
1. User opens the app → sees login page
2. Clicks "Setup Admin Account" link (bottom of auth card)
3. Fills in admin details (or uses pre-filled defaults)
4. Clicks "Create Admin Account"
5. Returns to login page
6. Logs in with newly created admin credentials
